## Introduction
Penetration testing is crucial for identifying system vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. This framework combines Metasploit's exploitation capabilities with BurpSuite's web vulnerability scanning to create a powerful and flexible testing suite.

## Features
- Integration of Metasploit and BurpSuite
- Automated scanning and exploitation
- Customizable modules
- Detailed reporting

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)
- [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
- Python 3.x
- Git

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-penetration-testing-framework.git
   cd custom-penetration-testing-framework
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure Metasploit and BurpSuite paths in the configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   nano config.json
   ```

## Usage
### Starting the Framework
1. Launch Metasploit:
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```

2. Start BurpSuite and ensure it is configured correctly.

3. Run the framework:
   ```bash
   python framework.py
   ```

### Running a Scan
1. Select the target and modules to be used.
2. Start the scanning process through the command interface.
3. Review the generated reports for identified vulnerabilities.
